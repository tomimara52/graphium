* Installation

  Download directory and run src_sh{cabal build}.

* Usage

  Run src_sh{cabal run}.

** There are two initial choices:
*** Load graph from file
  You'll have to type the name of the file 
*** Enter graph interactively
  If you want to save the graph you enter to a file, you will have to type it manually,
  because gloss doesn't allow to return the world state after the play function has started.

  The format for the graph files is:
  <v>| <vertices adjacents to v>

  Example of the table of a 3 complete graph:
  1| 23
  2| 13
  3| 12
  

  If you don't mind not saving the graph, you will be able to create it by clicking
  where you want the vertices to be and then clicking the pairs of vertices that should
  be adjacent.
